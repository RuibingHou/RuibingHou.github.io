I am currently an Associate Professor in Visual Information Processing and Learning (VIPL) group at the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). I received my Ph.D. from ICT, CAS in 2022, under the supervision of Prof. Hong Chang. My research interests mainly focus on multimodal large language model and 3D humam modeling. Feel free to reach out to me if you have an interest in the relevant topics.
